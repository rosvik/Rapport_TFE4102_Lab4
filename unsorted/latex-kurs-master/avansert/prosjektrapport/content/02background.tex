\section{Software Architecture}
\citet{softarch} defines software architecture as:

\blockquote{
    The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about
    the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties
    of both.
}

Every software system has an architecture, which is an abstraction where only the most
important details are included, and where the implementation details are left out.
Explained in another way, a system has multiple software modules or components, that communicate
with each other, and send and store different information.
